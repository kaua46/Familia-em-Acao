- Incorporate playful icons and emojis to reinforce emotions (e.g., ✨, 🙏, 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦, 🎁, 💡, 🧩) and create a friendly, engaging user experience.
- Use a vertical funnel layout to guide users through the content. Alternate between blue, yellow, purple, and white backgrounds for each section to maintain visual interest.
